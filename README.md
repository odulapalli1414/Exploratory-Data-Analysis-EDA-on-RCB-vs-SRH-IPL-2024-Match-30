    - Use BeautifulSoup to parse HTML files and extract match data.
    - Save extracted data into a structured format (CSV).
  
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
    - Clean the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
    - Prepare the data for analysis, including type conversion and normalization.
  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Perform EDA to understand the basic structure and distribution of the data.
    - Generate summary statistics and initial visualizations.
  
4. **In-depth Analysis**
    - Calculate team scores and performance metrics.
    - Analyze run distributions, top scorers, and bowlersâ€™ performance.
    - Examine types of dismissals and batting partnerships.
  
5. **Visualization**
    - Create detailed visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    - Use line plots, bar plots, and pie charts to represent different aspects of the data.
  
6. **Interpretation and Reporting**
    - Interpret the results from the analysis.
    - Compile a report summarizing key findings and insights.
